Calibration not accurate enough. 
We need some further fine tuning of the calibration, it doesn't always get right from the first time. Please try again, give your best to keep your head still and focus at the red dot.

Sorry, but we have lost your eyes. This is probably due to excessive head movements. Please try to recalibrate again and give your best to keep your head still.
