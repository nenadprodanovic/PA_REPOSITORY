Calibration not accurate enough. 
We need some further fine tuning of the calibration, it doesn't always get right from the first time. Please try again, give your best to keep your head still and focus at the red dot.

Bad Face Size!
Your face in the camera image is too big or too small. Please set your position again and repeat calibration.
